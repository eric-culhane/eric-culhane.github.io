“Virtual Materiality” is a three-part series of GIF and video art exhibited as a part of the Connections Virtual Art Space in May 2020. I consider the relationship between digital presence and its connection to the material world at three levels: individual, society, and the state, exploring themes of climate disaster, resource privatization, and posthumanism.
