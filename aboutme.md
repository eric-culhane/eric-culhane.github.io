<br>
Editor based in Los Angeles. I primarily cut home entertainment and pre-release content for theatrical film marketing. 

I also have experience cutting narrative film, documentary, montage and experimental short-form work.

With extensive experience supporting film marketing campaigns from several major studios (Warner Bros, Paramount, Amazon, Lionsgate, etc.), I enjoy cutting innovative, stylized pieces that engage audiences and support each campaign's creative vision.
